mymulch adds mulch to the game. You craft it from leaves, sticks, flowers and plants in the composter and can color it in the Mulch dye machine.

Simply craft a composter and open it. Added any combination of leaves, flowers, plants and sticks. Click the "make" button and you get tan colored mulch.
You can also dye the mulch in the composter.

Mulch is soil so you can grow any plants that require group:soil.
They are falling nodes. They need something under them just like gravel.
